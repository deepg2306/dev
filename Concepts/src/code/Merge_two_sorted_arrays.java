//Problem : https://javaconceptoftheday.com/merge-two-sorted-arrays-in-java/
//Write a Java program or function which takes two sorted integer arrays as input and merge them in sorted order. 
//For example, If arrayA = {-7, 12, 17, 29, 41, 56, 79} and arrayB = {-9, -3, 0, 5, 19} are two sorted integer 
//arrays then mergedArray must be {-9, -7, -3, 0, 5, 12, 17, 19, 29, 41, 56, 79}. Note that mergedArray is also sorted.


package code;

public class Merge_two_sorted_arrays {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] arrayA = {-9, -3, 0, 5, 19};
		int[] arrayB = {-7, 12, 17, 29, 41, 56, 79};
